            // understandable  -self documenting
            // maintainble-easy to modify when  needed, 

            // high quality methods --short written methods good methods names, and parameterNames, reduced complexity, improved readability 
            // high-quality documentation --?effective comments, self documentign code-. comments in english only!
            // well organized exception handling !!
            // wuality code instead of good performance!
